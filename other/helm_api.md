If there's an environment variable specifying the location of the Kubernetes configuration file, your Python script can be adapted to check for this environment variable first, and if it's not set, fall back to the default location (`~/.kube/config`). This approach allows users to customize the config file location while still supporting the standard location.

Here's how you can modify the script to handle an environment variable:

### Example Code

```python
import os
from kubernetes import client, config
from kubernetes.client.exceptions import ConfigException

def load_kube_config():
    # Check for an environment variable for the Kubernetes config path
    kube_config_path = os.getenv('KUBECONFIG')

    # If the environment variable is not set, fall back to the default path
    if not kube_config_path:
        kube_config_path = os.path.expanduser("~/.kube/config")

    # Check if the config file exists
    if not os.path.exists(kube_config_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Kubernetes config file not found at {kube_config_path}")

    try:
        # Load the Kubernetes config
        config.load_kube_config(config_file=kube_config_path)
        print("Kubernetes config loaded successfully")
    except ConfigException as e:
        raise ConfigException(f"Failed to load Kubernetes config: {str(e)}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        load_kube_config()
        # Now you can use the Kubernetes API client
        v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
        print("Successfully connected to the Kubernetes API")
    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e))
```

### Explanation

1. **Environment Variable (`KUBECONFIG`):**
   - The script first checks for the environment variable `KUBECONFIG` using `os.getenv('KUBECONFIG')`.
   - If `KUBECONFIG` is set, it uses the path specified by this variable.
   - If `KUBECONFIG` is not set, it defaults to `~/.kube/config`.

2. **Path Handling:**
   - After determining the path (either from the environment variable or the default location), the script checks if the file exists and then attempts to load it.

### Usage

- **Setting the `KUBECONFIG` Environment Variable:**
  - You can set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable in your shell before running the script:

    ```bash
    export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/custom/kubeconfig
    python your_script.py
    ```

- **Default Behavior:**
  - If the `KUBECONFIG` variable is not set, the script will automatically look for the config file at `~/.kube/config`.

This method ensures that your application can adapt to different user setups and environments, making it more versatile and user-friendly.



### Overview: What Are We Trying to Do?

You're working with a Django application that's deployed on a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. Specifically, you're using Helm (a package manager for Kubernetes) to manage the deployment of your Django application. The goal here is to:

1. **Identify the internal IP address** of the Kubernetes Service that is associated with your Django application.
2. Use this internal IP address to set up a **callback URL** for a specific part of your application (`aarp_ingestion_module_test`).

### Key Concepts

1. **Kubernetes Service:**
   - A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. In this case, the Service exposes your Django application inside the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Each Service has a **Cluster IP** (an internal IP address within the cluster).

2. **Helm:**
   - Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications. It uses **charts** (packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources) to deploy applications. When you deploy your Django app using a Helm chart, it typically creates a Service along with other resources.

3. **Service Discovery:**
   - You're trying to discover the correct Service that corresponds to your Django app and retrieve its internal IP address. This IP will be used to construct a callback address that other parts of your system will use to interact with your Django application.

### The Code Explained

Here’s the piece of code in question:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load the in-cluster configuration
config.load_incluster_config()

# Create a Kubernetes CoreV1Api client to interact with the API
core_v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

# Get the details of a specific Service within a namespace
service = core_v1.read_namespaced_service(name='django-experimentation-blb-service', namespace='default')

# Create a callback address using the Service's Cluster IP
callback_addr = f'http://{service.spec.cluster_ip}:8000/aarp_ingestion_module_test'
```

### What Does This Code Do?

1. **`config.load_incluster_config()`:**
   - This loads the Kubernetes configuration for when your Django application is running inside the Kubernetes cluster. This is necessary because, when running inside the cluster, your application uses the cluster’s internal configuration to interact with the Kubernetes API.

2. **`core_v1 = client.CoreV1Api()`:**
   - This creates an instance of the Kubernetes API client that can interact with core Kubernetes resources like Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.

3. **`service = core_v1.read_namespaced_service(name='django-experimentation-blb-service', namespace='default')`:**
   - This line fetches the details of a specific Service in the `default` namespace (a default Kubernetes namespace where resources are often deployed).
   - The `name='django-experimentation-blb-service'` parameter specifies which Service you want to retrieve.

4. **`callback_addr = f'http://{service.spec.cluster_ip}:8000/aarp_ingestion_module_test'`:**
   - This constructs a URL that includes the internal IP address (`cluster_ip`) of the Service.
   - This URL is used as a callback address, meaning other parts of your system can send requests to this address to interact with the `aarp_ingestion_module_test` endpoint.

### What Are We Trying to Achieve?

The problem you're trying to solve is dynamic discovery of the correct Service that corresponds to your Django application. You want to avoid hardcoding the Service name (`django-experimentation-blb-service`) because it could change depending on how the Helm chart is configured.

### Approaches to Solve This

1. **Dynamic Service Discovery Based on Helm Chart:**
   - If possible, use Helm templates to pass the Service name as an environment variable or directly in the code.

2. **Listing and Filtering Services:**
   - You could list all Services in the namespace and filter them based on certain criteria (e.g., labels) to identify the one associated with your Django app.

3. **Environment Variable:**
   - Set an environment variable during the Helm deployment that contains the name of the Service. The application can then use this environment variable to query the correct Service.

### Example of Listing and Filtering Services

If you want to dynamically search for the Service:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config

# Load the in-cluster configuration
config.load_incluster_config()

# Create a Kubernetes CoreV1Api client to interact with the API
core_v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

# List all services in the default namespace
services = core_v1.list_namespaced_service(namespace='default')

# Filter the services to find the one related to your Django app
for svc in services.items:
    if 'django' in svc.metadata.name:  # Example filter; adjust based on your naming convention
        service = svc
        break

# Create the callback address using the discovered Service's Cluster IP
callback_addr = f'http://{service.spec.cluster_ip}:8000/aarp_ingestion_module_test'
```

### Testing This in Your Environment

To test this:

1. **Deploy Your Django Application:**
   - Ensure your Django app is running in the Kubernetes cluster, deployed via the Helm chart.

2. **Check Logs or Outputs:**
   - Add print statements or logging to verify that the correct Service is being identified and that the callback URL is being constructed correctly.

3. **Debugging:**
   - If the service is not found or if the IP is incorrect, check the Kubernetes Services in the namespace using `kubectl get svc` to ensure that your code logic matches the actual resources.

This process will help you dynamically find and use the correct Service associated with your Django application when deployed within a Kubernetes cluster.
