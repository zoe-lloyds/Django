To dynamically determine the Kubernetes Service object that your Django application is using when deployed within a Kubernetes cluster (using Helm), you can follow one of these approaches:

1. **Derive the Service Name from the Helm Chart:**
   - If the service name follows a predictable pattern based on the Helm chart, you can programmatically determine it.
   - This can be done by either constructing the service name from the Helm release name and chart name or by querying the available services in the namespace and filtering based on known criteria.

2. **List All Services and Match:**
   - If the service name cannot be easily derived, you can list all services in the namespace and filter them based on specific attributes (like labels or annotations) to find the one associated with your Django application.

### Example Implementation

Here’s an example of how you might implement this:

```python
from kubernetes import client, config
import os

def get_django_service_name(namespace='default'):
    # Load in-cluster configuration
    config.load_incluster_config()
    core_v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
    
    # Option 1: Construct the service name based on Helm release and chart (if known)
    # Assuming the release name and chart name follow a pattern
    release_name = os.getenv("HELM_RELEASE_NAME", "django-experimentation")  # or derive it
    service_name = f"{release_name}-web-service"  # Example pattern
    
    try:
        # Try to read the specific service based on the derived name
        service = core_v1.read_namespaced_service(name=service_name, namespace=namespace)
        return service
    except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:
        print(f"Service {service_name} not found. Error: {str(e)}")
    
    # Option 2: List all services and filter
    services = core_v1.list_namespaced_service(namespace=namespace).items
    for svc in services:
        if "django" in svc.metadata.name:  # Adjust this filter as needed
            return svc
    
    raise RuntimeError("Could not find the Django service in the cluster")

# Usage
try:
    service = get_django_service_name()
    callback_addr = f'http://{service.spec.cluster_ip}:8000/aarp_ingestion_module_test'
    print(f"Callback address: {callback_addr}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error determining service: {str(e)}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Loading In-Cluster Config:**
   - `config.load_incluster_config()` loads the Kubernetes configuration from within a cluster. This is used when the code runs inside a pod.

2. **Option 1 - Constructing the Service Name:**
   - We attempt to construct the service name based on a known pattern or environment variable (like `HELM_RELEASE_NAME`). If the pattern is correct, it will retrieve the service.

3. **Option 2 - Listing and Filtering Services:**
   - If the service name isn’t easily derivable, we list all services in the namespace and filter them based on specific criteria (e.g., checking if "django" is in the service name).
   - This method is more flexible but may require refining the filtering logic.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Proper error handling is included to manage cases where the service isn’t found or other issues occur.

### Customization:
- **Pattern Matching:** The filter logic (`"django" in svc.metadata.name`) can be adjusted based on your service naming conventions or other identifiable attributes like labels.
- **Environment Variables:** The `HELM_RELEASE_NAME` environment variable can be used to dynamically determine the release name if set by Helm.

### Usage:
- The `callback_addr` is constructed using the `cluster_ip` of the identified service, which can then be used within your Django application to interact with the service.

This approach gives you flexibility depending on your Kubernetes and Helm setup, allowing you to either predict the service name or dynamically search for it.
