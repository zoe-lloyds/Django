Here’s how you might write unit tests for these two views:

1.	Testing the correct template: You’ll want to confirm that each view returns the expected template.
2.	Testing the response status code: Check that the response status code is 200 (OK), meaning the page loaded successfully.

You can do this with Django’s built-in test client, which allows you to simulate requests and check responses.

Example Unit Tests for index and interpreting_results
1.	Create a tests.py file in the same app directory as views.py (if you don’t already have it).
2.	Write the following tests:

```
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse

class ViewTests(TestCase):

    def test_index_view(self):
        # Simulate a GET request to the index view
        response = self.client.get(reverse('index'))  # assuming 'index' is the URL name for the view
        # Check if the status code is 200 (OK)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        # Check if the view uses the correct template
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'Reconciler/index.html')

    def test_interpreting_results_view(self):
        # Simulate a GET request to the interpreting_results view
        response = self.client.get(reverse('interpreting_results'))  # assuming 'interpreting_results' is the URL name for the view
        # Check if the status code is 200 (OK)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        # Check if the view uses the correct template
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'Reconciler/results.html')

```

Explanation
* reverse('index'): This function is used to get the URL for the index view by its name. You’ll need to ensure the URL name matches the name you use in your URL configuration.
* self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200): Checks that the view returns a successful (200 OK) response.
* self.assertTemplateUsed: Ensures the view uses the expected HTML template.


# Input view 
This InputView class is a Django class-based view that handles a form submission. Here’s a simple explanation:

* Purpose: It displays a form (specified by DataInputForm) to the user. When the form is submitted successfully, it saves selected files to the session for later use and redirects to a success page.

Key Components

1.	Form Setup:
form_class: Specifies the form class (DataInputForm) used for this view.
* template_name: Points to the HTML template used to render the form.
* success_url: Defines where the user is redirected after submitting the form successfully.
2.	Method: get_form_kwargs:
* Adds request to the form’s arguments. This allows the form to access request data, which may be necessary for user-specific data handling.
3.	Method: get_initial:
* Sets an initial value for the application_name field in the form with "reconciler", helping to pre-populate the form with this value.
4.	Method: form_valid:
* Called when the form is valid. It saves serialized data (from selected files) to the session under "reconciler_input_selected_files", making it available for later views. Finally, it redirects the user to success_url.

Unit Test for InputView

To test this view, we can check:

* If the form renders with the correct template.
* If the view redirects to success_url after a successful form submission.
* If the session stores the selected files data.

Here’s a sample unit test:


```
from django.test import TestCase, RequestFactory
from django.urls import reverse
from .views import InputView
from .forms import DataInputForm

class InputViewTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up any initial test data or configuration here
        self.factory = RequestFactory()
        self.url = reverse("Analytics:Reconciler:sheet_selection")

    def test_form_renders_correct_template(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse("input"))  # Assuming 'input' is the name for InputView in urls
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "Reconciler/input.html")

    def test_form_submission_success(self):
        # Mock form data
        form_data = {
            "files_and_folders": ["file1.txt", "file2.txt"],  # Adjust this as needed for your form fields
        }
        response = self.client.post(reverse("input"), data=form_data)

        # Check for redirection to success_url
        self.assertRedirects(response, self.url)

        # Check session data
        session_data = self.client.session.get("reconciler_input_selected_files")
        self.assertIsNotNone(session_data)  # Confirm data is saved
        # Optionally check the content if you know the expected structure

```

Explanation of the Test

1.	Setup:
* self.factory and self.url set up the testing environment and URL for success_url.
2.	Testing Template Rendering:
* The first test (test_form_renders_correct_template) ensures that a GET request to the view renders the correct template and returns a 200 status code.
3.	Testing Form Submission:
* The second test (test_form_submission_success) simulates submitting the form data as a POST request.
* It checks that the response redirects to success_url, confirming successful form handling.
* Finally, it verifies that the session stores the reconciler_input_selected_files data, as expected.
