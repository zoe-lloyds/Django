Here’s how you might write unit tests for these two views:

1.* Testing the correct template: You’ll want to confirm that each view returns the expected template.
2.* Testing the response status code: Check that the response status code is 200 (OK), meaning the page loaded successfully.

You can do this with Django’s built-in test client, which allows you to simulate requests and check responses.

Example Unit Tests for index and interpreting_results
1.* Create a tests.py file in the same app directory as views.py (if you don’t already have it).
2.* Write the following tests:

```
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse

class ViewTests(TestCase):

    def test_index_view(self):
        # Simulate a GET request to the index view
        response = self.client.get(reverse('index'))  # assuming 'index' is the URL name for the view
        # Check if the status code is 200 (OK)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        # Check if the view uses the correct template
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'Reconciler/index.html')

    def test_interpreting_results_view(self):
        # Simulate a GET request to the interpreting_results view
        response = self.client.get(reverse('interpreting_results'))  # assuming 'interpreting_results' is the URL name for the view
        # Check if the status code is 200 (OK)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        # Check if the view uses the correct template
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, 'Reconciler/results.html')

```

Explanation
*  reverse('index'): This function is used to get the URL for the index view by its name. You’ll need to ensure the URL name matches the name you use in your URL configuration.
*  self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200): Checks that the view returns a successful (200 OK) response.
*  self.assertTemplateUsed: Ensures the view uses the expected HTML template.


# Input view 
This InputView class is a Django class-based view that handles a form submission. Here’s a simple explanation:

*  Purpose: It displays a form (specified by DataInputForm) to the user. When the form is submitted successfully, it saves selected files to the session for later use and redirects to a success page.

Key Components

1.* Form Setup:
form_class: Specifies the form class (DataInputForm) used for this view.
*  template_name: Points to the HTML template used to render the form.
*  success_url: Defines where the user is redirected after submitting the form successfully.
2.* Method: get_form_kwargs:
*  Adds request to the form’s arguments. This allows the form to access request data, which may be necessary for user-specific data handling.
3.* Method: get_initial:
*  Sets an initial value for the application_name field in the form with "reconciler", helping to pre-populate the form with this value.
4.* Method: form_valid:
*  Called when the form is valid. It saves serialized data (from selected files) to the session under "reconciler_input_selected_files", making it available for later views. Finally, it redirects the user to success_url.

Unit Test for InputView

To test this view, we can check:

*  If the form renders with the correct template.
*  If the view redirects to success_url after a successful form submission.
*  If the session stores the selected files data.

Here’s a sample unit test:

```
from django.test import TestCase, RequestFactory
from django.urls import reverse
from .views import InputView
from .forms import DataInputForm
from UserFolder.models import UserChunkedUpload

 class InputViewTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.factory = RequestFactory()
        self.url = reverse("Analytics:Reconciler:sheet_selection")

    def test_form_renders_correct_template(self):
        # Test that the correct template is used
        response = self.client.get(reverse("input"))  # Assuming "input" is the name for InputView in urls
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "Reconciler/input.html")

    def test_form_submission_success(self):
        # Set up mock data in the database
        user_chunked_upload = UserChunkedUpload.objects.create(...)  # Add necessary fields

        # Mock form data for submission
        form_data = {
            "files_and_folders": [user_chunked_upload.pk],  # Adjust based on form requirements
        }
        response = self.client.post(reverse("input"), data=form_data)

        # Check redirection to success_url
        self.assertRedirects(response, self.url)

        # Check that session data is set correctly
        session_data = self.client.session.get("reconciler_input_selected_files")
        self.assertIsNotNone(session_data)  # Confirm data is saved
        # Optionally verify the content of session_data based on serialization output

    def test_get_form_kwargs_includes_request(self):
        # Simulate a request to check if 'request' is included in form kwargs
        request = self.factory.get(reverse("input"))
        view = InputView()
        view.request = request
        form_kwargs = view.get_form_kwargs()
        self.assertIn("request", form_kwargs)

    def test_get_initial_sets_application_name(self):
        # Check that 'application_name' is set to 'reconciler'
        view = InputView()
        initial_data = view.get_initial()
        self.assertEqual(initial_data.get("application_name"), "reconciler")
```

Explanation of the Test

1.* Setup:
*  self.factory and self.url set up the testing environment and URL for success_url.
2.* Testing Template Rendering:
*  The first test (test_form_renders_correct_template) ensures that a GET request to the view renders the correct template and returns a 200 status code.
3.* Testing Form Submission:
*  The second test (test_form_submission_success) simulates submitting the form data as a POST request.
*  It checks that the response redirects to success_url, confirming successful form handling.
*  Finally, it verifies that the session stores the reconciler_input_selected_files data, as expected.

# sheet selection
Certainly! Here’s a unit test for the SheetSelection view. This test will check:

1.* If the form renders with the correct template and initial data.
2.* If a successful form submission saves the selected sheets to the session and redirects to success_url.

To run this test, ensure that SheetSelectionFormSet and the session data (reconciler_input_selected_files) are correctly configured in your environment.

Unit Test for SheetSelection
```
from django.test import TestCase, RequestFactory
from django.urls import reverse
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from .views import SheetSelection
from .forms import SheetSelectionFormSet

class SheetSelectionViewTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up a test user and login
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username="testuser", password="12345")
        self.client.login(username="testuser", password="12345")
        
        # Define the URL for the view
        self.url = reverse("Analytics:Reconciler:sheet_selection")

        # Set up session data for input files (mock data)
        session = self.client.session
        session["reconciler_input_selected_files"] = [
            {"id": 1, "filename": "test_file.xlsx"},
            {"id": 2, "filename": "test_file_2.xlsx"}
        ]
        session.save()

    def test_form_renders_correct_template_and_initial_data(self):
        # Test if the view renders with the correct template and initial form data
        response = self.client.get(self.url)
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "Reconciler/sheet_selection.html")
        
        # Verify initial data in the form
        formset = response.context["formset"]
        initial_data = [{"file_id": 1, "file_name": "test_file.xlsx"},
                        {"file_id": 2, "file_name": "test_file_2.xlsx"}]
        for form, expected in zip(formset.forms, initial_data):
            self.assertEqual(form.initial, expected)

    def test_form_submission_success(self):
        # Mock form data with selected sheets for each file
        form_data = {
            "form-0-file_id": 1,
            "form-0-file_name": "test_file.xlsx",
            "form-0-sheet": "Sheet1",
            "form-1-file_id": 2,
            "form-1-file_name": "test_file_2.xlsx",
            "form-1-sheet": "Sheet2",
            "form-TOTAL_FORMS": "2",
            "form-INITIAL_FORMS": "2",
        }
        
        response = self.client.post(self.url, data=form_data)
        
        # Check that the response redirects to success_url
        success_url = reverse("Analytics:Reconciler:config")
        self.assertRedirects(response, success_url)

        # Verify session data is set correctly
        session_sheets = self.client.session["reconciler_sheets"]
        self.assertEqual(session_sheets, ["Sheet1", "Sheet2"])

    def test_form_invalid_submission(self):
        # Test submitting without selecting a sheet
        form_data = {
            "form-0-file_id": 1,
            "form-0-file_name": "test_file.xlsx",
            "form-0-sheet": "",  # No sheet selected
            "form-1-file_id": 2,
            "form-1-file_name": "test_file_2.xlsx",
            "form-1-sheet": "",  # No sheet selected
            "form-TOTAL_FORMS": "2",
            "form-INITIAL_FORMS": "2",
        }
        
        response = self.client.post(self.url, data=form_data)

        # Check the form errors and that it renders the same page
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertTemplateUsed(response, "Reconciler/sheet_selection.html")
        self.assertFormError(response, "formset", "sheet", "This field is required.")
```

Explanation of the Tests

1. test_form_renders_correct_template_and_initial_data:
* Sends a GET request to SheetSelection and checks that:
* The correct template (Reconciler/sheet_selection.html) is used.
* Initial data (from the session) is correctly passed to the form.

2. test_form_submission_success:
* Sends a POST request with mock form data, including selected sheets.
* Checks that:
* The response redirects to success_url.
* The session stores the selected sheets under reconciler_sheets.

3. test_form_invalid_submission:
* Simulates an invalid submission (no sheets selected).
* Ensures that:
* The page is rendered again with errors.
* The correct template is used, and the formset shows a required error for sheet.

This set of tests verifies that the view behaves as expected, handling valid and invalid form submissions and interacting with session data correctly.
